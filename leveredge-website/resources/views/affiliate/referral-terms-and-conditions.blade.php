            <h3 class="mt-4">The Juno Referral Program Summary</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                The Juno Referral Program rewards anyone who refers their friends or family members to refinance and/or originate their student loan(s) with a loan negotiated by LeverEdge Association (Juno) as long as the lender pays us a referral fee for the refinanced and/or originated loan. The referring person does NOT need to be a member of a Juno negotiation group.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Rewards</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Juno will reward $25 to the referrer and $25 to the referred borrower for each new borrower that is referred as part of our negotiation groups starting 4/4/2019.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-3">
                Based on the number of referred borrowers that originate student loans with a lender partnered with Juno, Juno will additionally reward prizes to the referrer as shown below:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 referred borrower = 1 Juno T-Shirt</li>
                <li>5 referred borrowers = 1 Herschel Backpack</li>
                <li>10 referred borrowers = 1 Apple Air Pods</li>
                <li>25 referred borrowers = 1 Apple Watch</li>
                <li>50 referred borrowers = $3,000</li>
                <li>100 referred borrowers = $10,000</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mt-3">
                For 500 referred borrowers, if the referrer is a student at an eligible program, Juno will reward 1 year's tuition up to a maximum of $80,000. Eligible programs are programs that are eligible for Graduate Student Loans from a lender partnered with Juno. If the referrer is not a student at an eligible program, Juno will reward $50,000.
            </p>

            <p class="mt-3">
                Numbers shown on the rewards tracker including, but not limited to, ‘Members Referred by You’, ‘# Taking the Deal’, and ‘Expected Cash Reward’ are provisional and subject to change before any rewards are paid out.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">Qualified Referrals</h3>
            <p class="mt-3">
                <strong>
                The referred borrower must have refinanced and/or originated their student loan(s) with a loan negotiated by Juno for which Juno is paid a referral fee by the lender. Juno will only pay one referral payment per borrower, regardless of when or how many loans refinanced and/or consolidated by the borrower.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                Referred borrowers can only be referred by one person.

            <p class="mt-3">
                Juno does not guarantee that mechanisms put in place for automatically tracking referrals will work flawlessly.

            </p>
            <p class="mt-3">
                To determine the number of referred members that take the negotiated loan, we may use a variety of methods. Some of these methods may be estimates. If the estimates are lower than your expectation, we will work with you to remedy the situation.
            </p>

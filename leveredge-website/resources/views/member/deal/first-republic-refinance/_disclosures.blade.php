        This product can only be used for personal, family or household purposes. It cannot be used for the following
        (among other prohibitions): to refinance or pay any First Republic loans or lines of credit, to purchase
        securities or investment products (including margin stock), for speculative purposes, for business or commercial
        uses, or for the direct payment of post-secondary educational expenses. This product cannot be used to pay off credit card debt at origination. The terms of this product may differ
        from terms of your current loan(s) that are being paid off, including but not limited to student loans. By
        repaying such loans, you may permanently be giving up tax and repayment benefits, including forbearance,
        deferment and forgiveness, and you may not be able to reobtain such benefits if this loan is refinanced with
        another lender in the future. Contact your legal, tax and financial advisors for advice on deciding whether
        this is the right product for you. Terms and conditions apply. Product is not available in all markets. For

        Applicants must meet a First Republic banker to open account. This is not a commitment to lend; all lending is
        subject to First Republic’s underwriting standards. Applicants should discuss line of credit terms, conditions
        and account details with their banker.

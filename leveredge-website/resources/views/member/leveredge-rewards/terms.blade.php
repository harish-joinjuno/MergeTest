            <h3>LEVEREDGE 2020 MEMBER REWARDS PROGRAM</h3>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions are for the Juno 2020 Member Rewards Program (“Rewards Program”). By initiating a redemption for a Reward (as described below), you acknowledge and agree to all of the provisions of these Rewards Program Terms and Conditions. Please read these Rewards Program Terms and Conditions carefully. THE REWARDS PROGRAM IS VOID WHERE PROHIBITED BY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LAW.</p>
            <h4>What is the Rewards Program?</h4>
            <p>
                Juno (“Juno”, “we” and “our”) is on a mission to use group buying power to save students,
                families, and alumni money.Juno receives a referral fee from most partners for each of our
                members who we refer to them and who renders a sale.
                <br>
                Juno takes a portion of this fee and passes it along to the member as a Reward.
            </p>
            <h4>Who is eligible for the Rewards Program?</h4>
            <p>All Juno members who we refer to a partner that pays us a fee and who accepts a private student loan or other specified service from June 15th, 2020 through May 31, 2021 are eligible for a Reward under this Rewards Program.
                <br>
                If you visit a partner’s website and purchase something we did not expressly direct you to, such as a mortgage, we will not be able to provide a reward for this.
            </p>
            <h4>How do I claim my Reward?</h4>
            <p>Visit <a href="//joinjuno.com/2020rewardsprogram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://joinjuno.com/2020rewardsprogram</a> and complete and submit the “Get Your Reward” form.</p>
            <h4>How will my Reward be paid to me?</h4>
            <p>Once you’ve claimed your Reward and we have verified that the partner has credited us with a referral fee, we will send you your choice of either a digital check or Amazon gift card in an amount equal to your Reward.</p>
            <h4>How can I use my Reward?</h4>
            <p>You can use your redeem Reward, in case of the digital check, whatever you like, or, in the case of an Amazon gift card, whatever Amazon.com allows you to purchase with your Amazon gift card.</p>
            <h4>Expiration of Rewards</h4>

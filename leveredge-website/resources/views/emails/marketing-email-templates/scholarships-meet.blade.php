<p>When I got into business school, I really wanted to get the best student loan out there. But it was hard to figure out which lender would give me the best rates, and how to make them go lower.</p>

<p>The first thing Nikhil (my friend and now co-founder) tried was getting a few dozen friends together and going to banks to get a bulk discount. They laughed in our faces and told us they needed more students.</p>

<p>So we got 700 students across the country and returned. They stopped laughing, and gave everyone in the group a discounted interest rate.</p>

<p>Since that first year, Juno has continued expanding, <a href="https://joinjuno.com/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=scholarship&utm_term=meet-hbs-1&utm_content=v1">helping more than 15,000 students</a> across the country save more than 26 million dollars.</p>

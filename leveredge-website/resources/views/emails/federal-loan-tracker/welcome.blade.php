<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Thanks for signing up to receive updates on federally held student loans.</p>

<p>We’ll be sending you periodic tl;dr updates on when you need to start thinking about making payments on your federal
loans again and what’s going on with loan forgiveness.</p>

<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> You can do a quick check-in on all your loan balances by viewing your credit report using free tools
such as CreditWise or Credit Karma.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if there’s anything you’re wondering about, feel free to reply to this email and we’ll try our best
to answer it! This will help us build out <a href="{{ url('/federal-loan-tracker') }}">our FAQ</a> and in case we
don’t know the answer, it will let us know what information we should keep an eye out for.</p>

<p>We’re in this together,</p>
<p>Team Juno</p>

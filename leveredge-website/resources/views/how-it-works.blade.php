                        We use group buying power to negotiate with lenders to get you the best interest rates available.
                        Think student loans, with a volume discount.

                        While we grow our group year round, our negotiations happen in the spring.
                        From there, we send all of our members a special link to access the lender who offered us
                        the lowest rates.

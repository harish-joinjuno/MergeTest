                <p><strong>LeverEdge Association is not an advisor</strong></p>
                <p>LeverEdge Association's services are only administrative. LeverEdge Association does not endorse or recommend the products of any particular Lender. Except as otherwise provided for your state, LeverEdge Association is not an agent of you or any lender. You should rely on your own judgment in deciding which available loan product, terms and Lender best suit your personal financial requirements.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3"><strong>LeverEdge Association does not discriminate</strong></p>
                <p>
                    The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicantâ€™s income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The agency that administers compliance with this law varies by lender depending on its lending authority, but may include the Federal Trade Commission, Equal Credit Opportunity, Consumer Response Center, Washington, DC 20580 or at 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357); TDD 1-866-653-4261; or at www.ftc.gov.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3"><strong>LeverEdge Association is not a creditor</strong></p>
                <p>
                    LeverEdge Association DOES NOT take mortgage, student loan, or refinance loan applications, originate, service, make loans or credit decisions in connection with loans, nor does LeverEdge Association issue commitments or lock-in agreements. Any loan inquiry you submit is NOT an application for credit. Rather, it is an inquiry to receive conditional loan offers from Lenders. You may have to complete an application with a Lender before they will extend an unconditional offer.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3"><strong>How LeverEdge Association makes money</strong></p>

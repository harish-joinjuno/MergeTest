                        Juno has been built from the ground-up to make sure that student interests are put first all the time. This extends to how we make money.

                <p class="mt-3">
                    We charge lenders a tiny fraction of the loan amount originated by members in our negotiation groups. We set this fraction at the very beginning of negotiations with the lenders. The same fraction is charged to all lenders attempting to win a given negotiation group. As a result, we only evaluate lenders based on the value they are creating for the students in the negotiation group.
                </p>

                <p class="mt-3">
                    Lenders cannot sway our decision by trying to offer a smaller or larger fraction.

                Switching to the negotiated deal from the federal loan is simple. Follow the steps below to make the switch.
            </p>

                <li>
                    Apply for the Juno deal.

                <li>
                    Assuming you are approved and like the rates, inform the financial aid office that you want to reduce or cancel the federal loan and replace it with the loan through Juno.

                <li>
                    Complete the process to get the Juno deal. Your financial aid office will do the rest.

                    That's it!
